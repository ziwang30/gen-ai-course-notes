# 🧠 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course Notes

## 📚 About the Notes

- ✅ Based on the official course materials and whitepaper.
- ✍️ Supplemented with additional explanations generated using ChatGPT.
- ⚠️ There may be mistakes — I'm still learning! Feel free to open an issue or PR if you spot any errors or have suggestions.
- 🔄 Notes will be **updated from time to time** as I revisit the material.
